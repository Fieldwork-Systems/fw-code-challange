# Airship Interview Coding Challenge

Ahead of the technical interview, please solve the five challenges below.

During the technical interview, we will spend 30 minutes pairing on the solutions and discussing any optimization opportunities.

## Setup

```
npm install
npm test -- --watch
```

## Challenges

### 1. Grouping Anagrams

Group the array of strings by their Anagram

### 2. Sorting string

Sort the strings in order (FYI, see note below)

### 3. Capitlize name

Format the names and return the formated value

### 4. Distinct numbers and order

Remove duplicates from the array of numbers

### 5. Fizz Buzz

Replace any number divisible by three with the word "fizz" any number divisible by five with the word "buzz" and any number divisible by both three and five with the word "fizzbuzz".

### Note

You do not have to use the `AppRunner.process` function for all your tests -
but feel free to update the function so it can be used in all tests

### Hint

This isn't a test about arrays or sorting, it's about how the AppRunner can get updated to handle all the different use cases.
